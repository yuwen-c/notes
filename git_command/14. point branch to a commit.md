# 在detached head 斷頭 狀態下，要把pointer指向某一個commit

- 想把HEAD跟原來的channel-extra branch綁在一起，但直接checkout過去分支是「沒有用」的

```bash
✘  ~/Documents/air-udn/operation-backstage   channel-extra ±  git checkout f38c906a8
Note: switching to 'f38c906a8'.

You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.

If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:

  git switch -c <new-branch-name>

Or undo this operation with:

  git switch -

Turn off this advice by setting config variable advice.detachedHead to false

HEAD is now at f38c906a8 chore: 調整快手新增表單表格欄寬/對齊；將編輯提示移出來
```

- 改為用git branch也沒用

```bash
~/Documents/air-udn/operation-backstage  ➦ f38c906a8  git checkout channel-extra
M       common
Warning: you are leaving 2 commits behind, not connected to
any of your branches:

  f38c906a8 chore: 調整快手新增表單表格欄寬/對齊；將編輯提示移出來
  c3d636fe1 chore: 調整上架快手的input提示、長寬高重的grid

If you want to keep them by creating a new branch, this may be a good time
to do so with:

 git branch <new-branch-name> f38c906a8       // 這個方法沒有試，不知道是不是兩個commit都會接到？

Switched to branch 'channel-extra'
```

```bash
~/Documents/air-udn/operation-backstage  ➦ f38c906a8  git branch channel-extra
fatal: A branch named 'channel-extra' already exists.
```

## google: point branch to a commit

- 底下這篇用了``git branch -f``，但怕commit進度會亂掉。
- 決定還是照git 建議的，直接從我想保留的commit 切新的分支出去。
