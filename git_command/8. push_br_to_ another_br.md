# 推到remote上，不同名的br - Push Branch to Another Branch

In some cases, you may want to push your changes to another branch on the remote repository.

**In order to push your branch to another remote branch, use the “git push” command and specify the remote name, the name of your local branch as the name of the remote branch.**

```
$ git push <remote> <local_branch>:<remote_name>
```

- 注意branch name 不能用:，否則這個指令會失敗。

`git push -u origin my_branch:remote_branch`
