[How do I check out a remote Git branch?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1783405/how-do-i-check-out-a-remote-git-branch)

> To expand on this: git doesn't allow you to work on someone else's branches. You can only work on your own. So if you want to add to someone else's branch, you need to create your own "copy" of that branch, which is what the above command does (well, it creates your branch and checks it out, too).
