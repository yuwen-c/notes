# checkout to certain commit

```bash
~/Documents/github/dieta   master  git checkout fa8b30c
Note: switching to 'fa8b30c'.

You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.

If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:

  git switch -c <new-branch-name>

Or undo this operation with:

  git switch -

Turn off this advice by setting config variable advice.detachedHead to false

HEAD is now at fa8b30c fix: sign up fail message
```

- 切回最新的commit之後發現沒有在master分支上

→ **所以 HEAD detached表示沒有連在分支上嗎？(正常terminal會顯示分支名，現在只有SHA)**

```bash
~/Documents/github/dieta  ➦ fa8b30c  git checkout 51f09d3
Previous HEAD position was fa8b30c fix: sign up fail message
HEAD is now at 51f09d3 fix: a bug happened when user routes to weight page and then to rateCalculation page, the weight state was cleared
 ~/Documents/github/dieta  ➦ 51f09d3  git log --oneline   
 ~/Documents/github/dieta  ➦ 51f09d3  git status
HEAD detached at 51f09d3
nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

- `git checkout master` 這樣HEAD就回到分支上面了，要有 `HEAD -> master` 才表示指向branch

```bash
51f09d3 (HEAD -> master, refac-func) fix: a bug happened when user routes to weight p
```

- `git checkout XXXX` HEAD會移動到那個SHA，如果只有 `HEAD, master` 「不」代表有黏在上面，只是在同一個進度

```bash
51f09d3 (HEAD, refac-func, master) fix: a bug happened when user routes to weight page and then to rateCalculation page, the weight state was cleared
```
