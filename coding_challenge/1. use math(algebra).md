# it's not a coding problem, it's all about math

> giving a n, n > 0, in the sequence of 1 ~ n, get 2 numbers a and b, where the product of a and b is equal to the rest of numbers
> which means: a*b = 1+2+3+...n - a - b,
> also means: a*b = n(n+1)/2
> where the formula of "SUM", sigma, is n(n+1)/2


## a programming way of thinking
- use a nested for loop to pick 2 numbers and calculate the sum and product
- which will cause a O(n^2) time complexity


## do it in a algebra way
- the sum of 1 to n = n(n+1)/2
- use the equation, we can get the relation between a and b
- turn it to the code

## blind point
- I still can write the code, since I thought we must have the a and b combination
- that's because we think it as a human way, human only counts as `natural numbers`
- Instead, with given a and n, we can **calculate** b, and check if b fits the conditions.

## other math issue - different signs in math and computer
- `2a`: wrong; `2*a`: correct.
- `n^2`: wrong; math.pow(n, 2): correct.
