### redux-persist, to persist redux value in local storage of browser

- like, if user refreshes the page, the cartItems will still be there
- install

`npm install redux-persist`

- import

`import {persistStore, persistReducer} from 'redux-persist'`

- use it as middleware
- also, storage

`import {storage} from 'redux-persist/lib/storage'`

- set black list or white list to decide which value you want to persist in local storage,

e.g. currentUser is not good to store since it may conflict with auth

- result
- process: when the app run, the persist part runs first, and do re-hydration
- loading property, decides which you want to render during loading, i think its loading effect

### process.env, only log in development environment

- check if it’s in dev env, or NOT in production env, if yes, use logger as middleware
- also add a security: `filter(Boolean)` , delete falsy middleware

### chrome dev-tool extension

- download chrome extension: redux dev-tool
- it acts as `compose` we’ve written in store, so replace the original compose with chrome one
- also, detect if there is window object (during build step there is not window object) , if yes, then use it
- some setting
- see how is it working: action, state, diff.
