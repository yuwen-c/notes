# `useReducer` hook reflections
## start from normal `useContext` (with `useState`)
- create context with init value, which contains readable values and set functions
- a provider to wrap components
- `useContext` to get value in UI components.

## now use useContext with `useReducer`
### same parts:
- create context with readable values and set functions
- provider

### differents:
- add reducer concepts, action types, action, reducer (init state). Selector is replaced by useContext here.
- all the reducer concepts can be included in the same context file.
- we don't use setState function in Provider logic, instead, declare a function which uses dispatch to pass action. -> this is the set function 
- `dispatch` comes from `useReducer`

```
  const [updatedState, dispatch] = useReducer(userReducer, INITIAL_STATE);
```

# `useReducer` hook basics

- in provider function (which returns `<Context.Provider>{children}</Context.Provider>)`

### replace `useState` (which controls `value` and `setValue` function) by `useReducer`
```
const [updated_state, dispatch] = useReducer(userRuducer, INITIAL_STATE)
```

### define how we want to change the state
```
const setCurrentUser = (received_user_from_firebase) => {
  const action = {
    type: 'SET_CURRENT_USER',
    payload: received_user_from_firebase,
  };
  dispatch(action);
}
```
