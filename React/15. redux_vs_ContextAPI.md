# difference between context API & redux

- context API can wraps partial of components
- redux can only wrap the entire app
- components that aren’t wrapped in context provider, can only access the initial value, such as `{ }`
- each context API has it’s own dispatch, a transport of action will only trigger a specific reducer
- on the contrary, redux can be seen as a complex of several reducers, it passes data to ALL components, and there is only ONE dispatch that will trigger ALL reducers.
- an action can trigger ALL components that use `useSelector` re-render, even if the changed reducer has nothing to do with the component. (即使是用不同的reducer的component，只要有使用`useSelector`，一旦有action，就會re-render) 

## most of the case we don’t use them together

- since it will be confusing that where the state is
- also it will be hard to deal with data

# start to use Redux

## installation
`$  npm install redux react-redux redux-logger`

## logger, middleware, compose function
- just follow the syntax
- will talk about them later.
- logger will tell you currentState and next state

## redux boilerplates

> src/store/store.js

- configuration. using middlewares, compose
- import root-reducer to create `store`

> src/store/root-reducer.js

- combine all the reducers together

> src/store/user/user-reducer.js
- can be seen as userReducer in our previous version
- **give a default value(init state) to currentState, since we defined it in `useReducer`**
- **also define a default return as currentState in reducer**


> src/store/user/user-reducer.js, <br/>
>               /user-action.js, <br/>
>               /user-selector.js, <br/>
>               /user-types.js, <br/>
- to break down all the parts
- types: action types
- reducer: initial value, reducer switch case
- selector: selector **which part of redux value you want**
- action: handle functions


## apply Redux
- `{useDispatch}`: like dispatch
- `{Provider}`: wrap App in index.js
- `{useSelector}`: extract data from store


# tips of migration to redux syntax, usually the difficult parts are `selector` and `action`
## `selector`
- put as pure as the value in redux
- e.g. originally we have cart useReducer like this
```
const INITIAL_STATE = {
  isCartOpen: false, // 是否開啟下拉購物車
  cartItems: [],     // 購物車內容物
  number: 0,         // 購物車內品項總數
  totalPrice: 0,     // 總金額
};
```
- but actually the number and totalPrice we can derive them with cartItems
- so instead, we can only put the necessary values in reducer
```
const INITIAL_STATE = {
  isCartOpen: false, // 是否開啟下拉購物車
  cartItems: [],     // 購物車內容物
}
```
- and calculate them in `selector`

## `action`
- where we put handle functions
- **only return the action, the `dispatch` part can only get in UI component.**
- in context environment, we can access values, but in reducer one we cann't
- instead, **we can pass redux value in UI component.**
