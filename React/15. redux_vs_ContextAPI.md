# difference between context API & redux

- context API can wraps partial of components
- redux can only wrap the entire app
- components that aren’t wrapped in context provider, can only access the initial value, such as `{ }`
- each context API has it’s own dispatch, a transport of action will only trigger a specific reducer
- on the contrary, redux can be seen as a complex of several reducers, it passes data to ALL components, and there is only ONE dispatch that will trigger ALL reducers.

## most of the case we don’t use them at once

- since it will be confusing that where the state is
- also it will be hard to deal with data

# start to use Redux

## installation
`$  npm install redux react-redux redux-logger`

## logger, middleware, compose function
- just follow the syntax
- will talk about them later.
- logger will tell you currentState and next state

## redux boilerplates

> src/store/store.js

- configuration. using middlewares, compose
- import root-reducer to create `store`

> src/store/root-reducer.js

- combine all the reducers together

> src/store/user/user-reducer.js
- can be seen as userReducer in our previous version

> src/store/user/user-reducer.js, <br/>
>               /user-action.js, <br/>
>               /user-selector.js, <br/>
>               /user-types.js, <br/>
- to break down all the parts


## apply Redux
- `{useDispatch}`: like dispatch
- `{Provider}`: wrap App in index.js
- `{useSelector}`: extract data from store
