# conclusion goes first:

## know reducer conceptually
- reducer is a design pattern to manage state
- unlike `useState` in react, it separates `states` and `setState` function, reducer only care about `WHAT` will be the state instead of `HOW` the state is going to change.
- reducer only cares about three things: `initial state`, `action`, `outcome` = `updated state`

## comparison:
- reducer seems complicated than useState, but is better when we have more complexity in state and the project scales
- when one thing changes will trigger multiple states change, it's time to use reducer (imagine that you have to deal with those states separately)

## important things about using reducer
- reducer only store readable values
- DO NOT put any business logic in reducer function
- process payload and then pass to reducer


# use React concept to manage states

## useState and useEffect
- each state is stored by one `useState`
- each one usually is moderated by one `useEffect` 
- when action trigger multiple state change, need to define states one by one.

## Reducer DESIGN PATTERN 
- the whole state is an big object
- what we really care are `initial_state`, `action`, and it's `outcome`

### INITIAL_STATE
- declare an object as the initial state

### action :  `{ type , payload }`
- type: a description of the action.
  - use ENUM object
- payload: optional. can by anything.

### outcome
- a switch case to enumerate in which type, what state will be returned.

### tool: `dispatch`
- a function that pass action `({type, payload})`

### state process function
- define a function with dispatch, to carry action, and complete the state update.


# how to use `useReducer` 
- use it in context (context and provider)

## self-defined `Reducer`
- out side of provider function
```
const userReducer = (current_state, action) => {
  const {type, payload} = action;
  switch(type){
    case 'some_type':
      return {
        ...current_state,
        updated_state,
      }
    case 'some_type_2':
      ...
  
    default:
      throw new Error(`unhandled type ${type} in userReducer`);
  }

}
```

## ENUM of action types, to reduce typo
```
const USER_ACTION_TYPES = {
  SET_CURRENT_USER: 'SET_CURRENT_USER',
  ...
  ...
}
```

## INITIAL_STATE 
```
const INITIAL_STATE = {
  currentUser: null,
  ....
}
```

## `useReducer` hook
- in provider function (which returns `<Context.Provider>{children}</Context.Provider>)`

### replace `useState` (which controls `value` and `setValue` function) by `useReducer`
```
const [updated_state, dispatch] = useReducer(userRuducer, INITIAL_STATE)
```

### define how we want to change the state
```
const setCurrentUser = (received_user_from_firebase) => {
  const action = {
    type: 'SET_CURRENT_USER',
    payload: received_user_from_firebase,
  };
  dispatch(action);
}
```
