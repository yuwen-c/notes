# recap
- in `src/store/store.js` we use middleware and compose enhancer to create the store.
```
const middleWares = [logger];
const composeEnhancer = compose(applyMiddleware(...middleWares));
export const store = createStore(rootReducer, undefined, composeEnhancer);
```
- UI components get value from stroe through `useSelector` 

# what’s happened inside of middleware, currying, execution order, useSelector

- middleware does 2 things, one, it’s own logic, two, pass the action with `next()` to next middleware, or redux store
- middleware always follow the syntax of currying,

```jsx
state, next, action
```

- when redux receives any action, the store returns a new store object, and all components that hook into the store (ie, use `useSelector`), will re-run.
- if we split out all the steps with our customized logger, we can see after the `next(action)`, store change, useSelector runs, and components run, then continue…


# what does middleware do in redux system?
- middleware lives in the middle of UI component and redux
- it receives action from dispatch, then pass action to next middleware, or to redux
- a middleware does 2 things:
```
// its own logic
logic();

// and pass the action through next()
next(action);
```

# execution order of `UI component`, `useEffect`, `useSelector`, `selector.js`
- think of the order here
```js
// UI component
const Category = () => {
  console.log("category component re-render");     // 1
  
  const { category } = useParams();
  const categoriesMap = useSelector(selectCategoriesMap);
  const [products, setProducts] = useState(categoriesMap[category]);

  useEffect(() => {
    console.log("useEffect");             // 4, after return() ***
    setProducts(categoriesMap[category]);
  }, [categoriesMap, category]);
  
  return (
    console.log("return")       // 3
    ...
  )
  
// selector.js
export const selectCategoriesMap = (state) => {
  console.log("categories selector");             // 2, since useSelector trigger this function
  return state.categories.categories
}
```
## weird part: what happened after useEffect gets called (4) ?
- we thought that since state has changed, the UI component will then re-run, but NO.
- after useEffect, the selector runs, then UI component runs.

## why is that?
- because middleware does 2 things, one, its own logic, two, pass the action via next()
- so we can see the second time selector runs.

## break it down with customize-logger

### `currying` structure of middleware function
- 3 params: store, next, action
- imitate logger that console out actions, currentState, nextState
```
const customLogger = (store) => (next) => (action) => {
  if (!action.type) {
    return next(action);
  }
  console.log("action: ", action);
  console.log("current state:", store.getState());
  next(action);
  console.log("next state: ", store.getState());
};

const middleWares = [customLogger];
const composeEnhancer = compose(applyMiddleware(...middleWares));
export const store = createStore(rootReducer, undefined, composeEnhancer);
```
### selector runs between currentState and nextState
- since `react-logger` boundle the 2 states, we have a wrong impression of the order.
