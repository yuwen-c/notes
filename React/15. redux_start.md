### difference between context API & redux

- context API can wraps partial of components
- redux can only wrap the entire app
- components that aren’t wrapped in context provider, can only access the initial value, such as `{ }`
- each context API has it’s own dispatch, a transport of action will only trigger a specific reducer
- on the contrary, redux can be seen as a complex of several reducers, it passes data to ALL components, and there is only ONE dispatch that will trigger ALL reducers.

### most of the case we don’t use them at once

- since it will be confusing that where the state is
- also it will be hard to deal with data

### redux boilerplate

- src/store/store.js
- src/store/reducer
- migrating reducer to redux,
- redux also need a provider
- then learn how we are going to react with the redux,

### logger, middleware, compose function

- just follow the syntax
- will talk about them latter.

## installation
`$  npm install redux react-redux redux-logger`
