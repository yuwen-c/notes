# selector and re-render

## more details about `useSelector`
- whenever the state object is updated, ALL the `useSelector` s get fired, (even if the useSelector DOES NOT point to the changed reducer) and receive a value
- if the returned value is the same as the previous value, then this UI component will NOT re-render (CANNOT see the re-render LOG)
- here the returned value means only the reducer you are pointing to, like category/ currentUser.

## extra re-render in our app
1. when we first run the app, in category page, UI component first renders
2. then `useSelector` runs, get category as undefined
3. useEffect's callback runs, since the category is now undefined, `undefined === undefined`, UI will NOT re-render.
4. a auth change triggers logger to prints action and currentState (category === empty array), also triggers `useSelector` of category running
5. since now the category remains empty array, we can assume that the UI component WILL NOT re-render
6. BUT UI component DO re-render, although category remains an empty array, since the logic in `selector.js` is returning an array, so that every time the `ref` is different, and the component gets re-run
