# installation
- redux dev-tools in browser
- npm install `redux`, `react-redux`, `react-logger`. `react-logger` is optional.


## setting
```
- store

  - cart > then 4 templates
  - user > then 4 templates
  - categories > then 4 templates
  - rootReducer.js
  - store.js

```

### rootReducer
- bind reducers together

```
import { combineReducers } from "redux";
import { categoriesReducer } from "./category/categories.reducer";
import { userReducer } from "./user/user.reducer";
import { cartReducer } from "./cart/cart.reducer";

export const rootReducer = combineReducers({
  user: userReducer,
  categories: categoriesReducer,
  cart: cartReducer,
});

```

### store.js
- setting

```
import { compose, applyMiddleware } from 'redux';
import { legacy_createStore as createStore } from 'redux';
import logger from 'redux-logger';
import { rootReducer } from './rootReducer';
import thunk from 'redux-thunk';

const middleWares = [
  process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production' && logger,
  thunk,
].filter(Boolean);

const composeEnhancer =
  (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production' &&
    window &&
    window.__REDUX_DEVTOOLS_EXTENSION_COMPOSE__) ||
  compose;
const composeEnhancers = composeEnhancer(applyMiddleware(...middleWares));

export const store = createStore(rootReducer, undefined, composeEnhancers);

```

### legacy_createStore
- if we import {createStore} from 'redux`, it shows that it's deprecated.
> @deprecated
> We recommend using the configureStore method of the @reduxjs/toolkit package, which replaces createStore.

> Redux Toolkit is our recommended approach for writing Redux logic today, including store setup, reducers, data fetching, and more.

> For more details, please read this Redux docs page: https://redux.js.org/introduction/why-rtk-is-redux-today

> configureStore from Redux Toolkit is an improved version of createStore that simplifies setup and helps avoid common bugs.
