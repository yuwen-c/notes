/* routing: 
1. import Routes from "react-router-dom",
2. wrap Route with Routes  
3. define the Route path and component*/

/* add a new page:
1. defined routes in app 
2. build a page for this route
3. a link to enter the page */

/* to locate the components which always render,
like navigator bar, use nested ROUTE and <Outlet> */

/* for nested home page route, use index instead of path */
