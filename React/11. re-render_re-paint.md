# Conclusion

## when does a component re-render?
- state changes
- prop changes
- it’s parent gets re-render, **even if there is no props passed in**
- also, if it's using `useContext`. (even if the value of context isn't being used)
> A component calling useContext will always re-render when the context value changes. If re-rendering the component is expensive, you can optimize it by using memoization. (React official)
> 可推導：ref沒有改變，就不會re-render

## what causes re-render
- setState in class
- change of state, value or `ref` in functional component

## why doesn’t my component re-render?
- modify state w/o correct method.
- state holds the same value or `ref`

## re-render has two meanings
- In React, this means calling the **render function**.
- In the real DOM, this means **re-painting** the UI.

## other points
- react “schedules” a render when a state changes. → doesn’t mean it will do it immediately
- batching: react waits for several setStates happened and does one re-render (that’s why you cannot get the right value immediately after setState)
- the whole functional component is equal to the render function in class component

## about optimization of performance

- structure of component is much more important than using memo…or it’s friends
- should put logic as close as where the data you need, you don’t even need memo.

# 之前functional component不了解的地方
- 值有改變，但畫面沒有重新render：       
> 值要存在state裡面，當他改動時，才會觸發re-render
- functional component re-render時，會重新執行一次function，from top to bottom，useEffect也會被執行，但裡面的callback只有在dependency changes時才會被觸發。
- re-render不代表會改變DOM，當畫面有改變，react才會update DOM         
> re-render ≠ re-paint


# Re-render and re-paint
**you can see actual painting from painting flashing in console tool**
- real DOM vs. virtual DOM  /  snapshot of virtual DOM vs. copy of virtual DOM
- re-render part (I guess) is the process of drawing the VIRTUAL DOM and comparing the changes (called `diffing`)
- re-paint part, which is the **real expensive one**, the process of changing the REAL DOM
- `reflow` :
    - when a component is added(mounted) or removed(un-mounted) from the page, all remain nodes shifting their position.
    - is inside of paint process, is not that expensive tho.
    - not that expensive

# life-cycle thing

## mounting phase

- run constructor first
- render: react update DOM (mounting)
- DidMount()

## updating phase

- new props/ setState happen
- render (updating)
> class component only run “render” part.
- DidUpdate()

## unmounting phase

- a node is being pulled off from the page, like direct to another page.
- WillUnMount(), clean up the listener.

## how about functional component
- when state changes or props change, re-render.
- when re-render, run the whole function, from top to bottom, including `useEffect`.
- **BUT, the callback function inside of useEffect doesn’t run until it’s dependency changes**
- the useState set function DOES NOT trigger re-render, only the `value` / `ref` **unlike class component, setState will always trigger re-render**


# `useContext`, context's change will trigger re-render
- if the value in context changes, all the components use context will re-render
- even if the component doesn't use the context value actually.
(有呼叫useContext的元件都會re-render (但不一定會update DOM，有差異才會update)
- so use `context` carefully
