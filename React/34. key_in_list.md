# Why does React need key and why can't we use index as key?

Keys help React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed. Keys should be given to the elements inside the array to give the elements a stable identity:

[Lists and Keys - React](https://reactjs.org/docs/lists-and-keys.html)

We don’t recommend using indexes for keys if the order of items may change. This can negatively impact **performance and may cause issues with component state**. Check out Robin Pokorny’s article for an [in-depth explanation on the negative impacts of using an index as a key](https://robinpokorny.com/blog/index-as-a-key-is-an-anti-pattern/)
. If you choose not to assign an explicit key to list items then React will default to using indexes as keys.
