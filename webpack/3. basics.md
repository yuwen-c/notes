# 4 points

- a file as an entry point, usually `index.js` file, tells webpack to start from here and read all the other files
- a folder where webpack put its output files, static assets
- loaders, inside of webpack, compile code, like babel, transform JS from es6 to es5
- plugins, let webpack to bundle as we need

## need to know first

- the most important part of bundling is the configuration
- and it changes from time to time
- when a new version of webpack is released, the configuration needs to be changed, so donâ€™t spend a lot of time on it. Just take the part you need.
