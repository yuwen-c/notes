# 4 points

- a file as an entry point, usually `index.js` file, tells webpack to start from here and read all the other files
- a folder where webpack put its output files, static assets
- loaders, inside of webpack, compile code, like babel, transform JS from es6 to es5
- plugins, let webpack to bundle as we need

# webpack的作用
- bundle 檔案，讓檔案變小，成為js, css, html等static assets
- compile code，像是babel，可以把es6語法轉為es5 (編譯、兼容性)
- 把不用的檔案拿掉


# what for? - performance improve

- how is the network working? → browser sends requests, server responds files
- there are three parts involving:

→ front-end browser: receives files and renders

→ network: transfer files, lentancy

→ back-end server:  processing, load data

## when do i need to improve performance

- need to be a big ticket item
- focus on what let your website slow

# what happens after a website request? `critical render path`

> request → send html file → browser reads html 
→ reaches `<style>` tag and requests css file → receives css file
→ create DOM and also `cssom`  = `(css object model)` , css tree model
→ reaches `<script>` tag and requests JS file → receives it
→ browser combines `DOM` and `cssom` to a `render tree`
→ figures out the `layout` , the skeleton of this page
→ starts to paint pixels → displaying web page
→ meanwhile downloads `<jpg>`

## 2 bottlenecks

1. loading JS files

> bundle files with tools: parcels (zero configuration), webpack, rollup.js
> 

> webpack → big project, CRA has it pre-built
Parcels → small project running by yourself
rollup.js → an npm package
> 
1. when modifying page, re-render(re-paint) it.

> solution: react, redux
> 

# need to know first

- the most important part is bundling is the configuration
- and it changes from time to time
- when a new version of webpack is released, the configuration needs to be changed, so don’t spend a lot of time on it. Just take the part you need.
