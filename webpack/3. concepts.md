# webpack 幫我們做什麼事？

1. 編譯：ES6→ ES5, jsx 語法，commonJS 的語法(require, export)
2. minify, uglify
3. filter
4. 編譯 SASS

# webpack, a module bundler

- 參考系列文：[https://ithelp.ithome.com.tw/users/20107440/ironman/1355]
- webpack 幫我們把 js 的 require, export 編譯成瀏覽器看得懂的語法，來達到「模組化」，所以 webpack 被稱為模組打包工具，「module bundler」。
- 而在 node 環境本來就支援 require, export，所以不需要使用 webpack

## 使用  `webpack`  來編譯我們的 JavaScript ，總共有幾個好處

1. 當我們有多個檔案時，不必每個都引入，只要使用  `build.js`  即可
2. 我們全部的檔案都包在  `build.js`  裡面要存取網頁時所需要的請求變少
3. 使用模組化的開發方式，我們可以完全避免全域變數的衝突

# 4 points

- a file as an entry point, usually `index.js` file, tells webpack to start from here and read all the other files
- a folder where webpack put its output files, static assets
- loaders, inside of webpack, compile code, like babel, transform JS from es6 to es5
- plugins, let webpack to bundle as we need

# webpack 的作用

- bundle 檔案，讓檔案變小，成為 js, css, html 等 static assets
- compile code，像是 babel，可以把 es6 語法轉為 es5 (編譯、兼容性)
- 把不用的檔案拿掉

# what for? - performance improve

- how is the network working? → browser sends requests, server responds files
- there are three parts involving:

→ front-end browser: receives files and renders\
→ network: transfer files, latency\
→ back-end server: processing, load data

## when do i need to improve performance

- need to be a big ticket item
- focus on what let your website slow

# what happens after a website request? `critical render path`

> request → send html file → browser reads html
> → reaches `<style>` tag and requests css file → receives css file
> → create DOM and also `cssom` = `(css object model)` , css tree model
> → reaches `<script>` tag and requests JS file → receives it
> → browser combines `DOM` and `cssom` to a `render tree`
> → figures out the `layout` , the skeleton of this page
> → starts to paint pixels → displaying web page
> → meanwhile downloads `<jpg>`

## 2 bottlenecks

1. loading JS files

> bundle files with tools: parcels (zero configuration), webpack, rollup.js

> webpack → big project, CRA has it pre-built
> Parcels → small project running by yourself
> rollup.js → an npm package

1. when modifying page, re-render(re-paint) it.

> solution: react, redux

# need to know first

- the most important part is bundling is the configuration
- and it changes from time to time
- when a new version of webpack is released, the configuration needs to be changed, so don’t spend a lot of time on it. Just take the part you need.
