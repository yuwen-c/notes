# CSS Box Model

- [https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_boxmodel.asp]
- from inside to outside: content -> padding -> border -> margin
- when you set a `width` and `height` to an element, you actually are giving attributes to `content` only.
- to get the total width and height of an element, you have to add them all: height/ width + padding(both sides) + border(both sides) + margin(both sides)

## outline

- is outside of border, inside of margin.
