# 設定寬度用 `flex: 1`

- 在每一個tab去設定flex: 1 1就可以撐開，變成1/3份的寬度


```css
.block-tabs__tab {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: center;
    text-align: center;
    flex: 1 1;
    position: relative;
    height: 40px;
    margin: 0;
    border-bottom: 2px solid white;
    cursor: pointer;

```

> flex: <positive-number>
> Equivalent to flex: <positive-number> 1 0. Makes the flex item flexible and sets the flex basis to zero, resulting in an item that receives the specified proportion of > the free space in the flex container. If all items in the flex container use this pattern, their sizes will be proportional to the specified flex factor.
