# background-image not working?

[https://coder-coder.com/how-to-fix-css-background-image-not-working/]

> found this article when I set background-image to a `<div>` in weebpack project, the image didn't work.

## check if css is actually link to html file <- checked

- also check if the css file is loaded by checking in network

## make sure the image URL is set correctly <- checked

- with the cursor I can see the picture in dev tool.

## Explicitly set the element width or/and height <- solved my problem

> actually with the inspector I could find this problem, the element is 500px\*0
