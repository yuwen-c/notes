# `zsh: command not found: npm`
- node can be found, but npm cannot in zsh
- npm can be found in bash

- there is a line in `~/.zshrc` saying that if you come from bash, change export path
- but mac monterey comes with zsh, so this does not work for me.

- export the right path and npm works in zsh.

```
export NVM_DIR=~/.nvm
 [ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && . "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"
```
