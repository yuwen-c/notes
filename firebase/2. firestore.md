# firestore and authentication
- social login autherntication is a seperate service fron firestore
- firestore is a database service
- to store and use the user data in a better way, it's recommended that store user data in firestore


## setting firestore
- use production mode
- set autherntication of write and read to true. (default is false)
- with the original configuration of social login is just fine. no need to add more config.


# usage and concept
- import the service: 
`import { getFirestore, doc, getDoc, setDoc } from "firebase/firestore";`

## `doc`
- use a `ref` to point to the table, ie. document.
- the process is: check if this `ref` exists, if not, create one
- need to give it an uid
- 

## `getDoc` and `snapShot`
- `snapShot` is a piece of data that we retrieve from the table
- get this smapShot with  `getDoc` method and `ref`
- use `await`

## `userSnapShot` and `exist()`, `setDoc`
- check if this user exist, if not create it with `setDoc`
- use `await`
- use try catch to prevent crash

# a little bit of explanation of firestore
- thinking of our data stored in a folder, a collection, there are documents in it.
> it's table <br/>
> like shoe category.

- every document is a paper that carry some related info and has an unique id
> NikeAirMax is a document <br/>
> a data row

- the info on the paper is data
> price, currency, url,  <br/>
> some fields
