# what does firebase authentication do?

## why do we need authentication?
- let certain people do certain things
- CRUD: create, read, update, delete


## firebase stands for a server of our application, a database
- so when firebase receives a request, he needs to confirm the person.

## use google login, the social login(第三方登入)
