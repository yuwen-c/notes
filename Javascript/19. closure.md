# something related
- react component裡，沒有清除的event listener，會留在closure裡面。

# try to describe closure
- a function that returns another function
- the "child function" receives a parameter which comes from its lexical context = the parent function
- even if the parent function has been executed, the child function still can access the parameter

# discover closure through setTimeout in for loop
```
for(i = 1; i < 5; i++){
	setTimeout(()=> console.log(i), 1)
}

// i=1~4 -> 印出 4個5

```

## why is this happened?
- when console callback need the variable, it access i from outer scope, in this time, i === 5

## TRAP: when does a for loop end? why i === 5 instead of 4 ?
- when i===4, i++, then i===5
- runs the condition and found that i doesn't < 5, so for loop ends with i===5
- **for loop ends when the i doesn't match the condition**

# Extention: `var` and `let`, difference: BLOCK scope and FUNCTION scope
- var variable is limited in function, but not in BLOCK SCOPE, variable can be accessed OUTSIDE of if/else
- let variable is limited in BLOCK SCOPE, like: for loop, if/else, try/catch

```
// but var is not restricted by if scope
if (true) {
  var a = 3
  console.log("if var", a)
}
console.log(a)  // a = 3


// let does
if (true) {
  let b = 5;
  console.log("if let", b)

}
console.log(b). // ERROR, b is not defined

```


# when does setTimeout starts to count? - `async` means that it executes in the background
- when the engine put setTimeout to event loop, it starts to count
- when time's up, throw it to execution stack
- **so, when does a 1000ms callback funtion get run? - after 1000ms being thrown to event loop, AND after the current sync code is terminated.**





# is a trap but also a tool
- maybe the libraries use closure to independent variables
