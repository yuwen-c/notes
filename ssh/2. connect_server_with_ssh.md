## a remote server

- first, open a server on digital ocean
- connect to the server with: ssh user@server

### example 1:

> here is what we are going to do:

> since our app has been deleted on the server, we need to clone the app again, then build it, just like we did when the app has been launched.

> we are now currently using our own computer and connect to the server on digital ocean and operate it.

- $ sudo apt-get install git : install git in ubuntu so that we can use git command in the server

- git clone the app from remote repo

- then cd to the app folder and do npm install

- if there is node, apt-get nodejs

### example 2:

> the app we want to install to the server is not on github, is in local compouter

- $ exit: leave the remote server

- copy the app in local to ubuntu server with command: rsync
