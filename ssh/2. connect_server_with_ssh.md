## a remote server

- first, open a server on digital ocean
- connect to the server with: ssh user@server

### example 1:

> here is what we are going to do:

> since our app has been deleted on the server, we need to clone the app again, then build it, just like we did when the app has been launched.

> we are now currently using our own computer and connect to the server on digital ocean and operate it.

- $ sudo apt-get install git : install git in ubuntu so that we can use git command in the server

- git clone the app from remote repo, to our computer (on digital ocean)

**此處 ssh 的重點是，我可以在我家，用我的電腦，連線到遠端的 server(這邊的例子是 digital ocean)，以這台遠端電腦的角色，去操作(例如 clone repo)**

- then cd to the app folder and do npm install

- if there is node, apt-get nodejs

### example 2:

> the app we want to install to the server is not on github, is in local compouter

- $ exit: leave the remote server

- copy the app in local to ubuntu server:

1. 先從 ubuntu server checkout 到本機的電腦，從 terminal 進入該 repo 的 folder
2. `$ rsync -av . user@server:/home/user/app:~/superawesome.com` : 將本機的 app 複製到遠端的 server 底下的 superawesome.com 這個 folder
3. 再度`# ssh root@server` 進入 server，進入 superawesome.com folder，做 npm install
